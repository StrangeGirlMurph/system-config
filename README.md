# My NixOS system

Configuration and dotfiles for my complete NixOS (Linux) system using Hyprland.

**Work in Progress!** I will add explanations and so on later. Don't take this config as a good example for you to reproduce. I am still very early in my journey to learn NixOS and configure my system. When I remove this notice I am confident in it and you can take this as insparation.

To install run `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StrangeGirlMurph/system-config/master/install.sh | sh -s "TARS"` (or with `"CASE"`) on a clean install of NixOs. (If you need to connect to a wifi use `nmtui`)
